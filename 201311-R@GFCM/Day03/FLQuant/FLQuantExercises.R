# FLQuant exercise

# There are two *.csv files of data:
#    stock_w.csv - stock weights by year and age
#    stock_n.csv - stock numbers by age and year

# Using your R powers:
#    Read these two data sets in
#    Create an FLQuant of each one
#    Create a new FLQuant which holds the total biomass of the stock
