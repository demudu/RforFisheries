# FLQuant exercise

# There are two *.csv files of data:
#    stock_w.csv - stock weights by year and age
#    stock_n.csv - stock numbers by age and year

# Using your R powers:
#    1. Read these two data sets in
#    2. Create an FLQuant of each data set
#        Note: check orientation of the data. The transpose function t() may be useful
#    3. Create a new FLQuant which holds the total biomass of the stock
#        Note: Are the FLQuant objects the same size?
#    4. What is the mean total biomass of the last 3 years?
