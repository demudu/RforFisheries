# FLStock exercises

# This is a long and tedious exercise!
# There is a spreadsheet 'haddock.ods' which has data for:
# fishing mortality by age and year
# stock numbers by age and year
# catch numbers by age and year
# catch weight by age and year
# proportion mature by age and year
# natural mortality by age
# stock weight by age and year
# proportion of F and M before spawning (single value each)

# From this spreadsheet make an FLStock and calculate:
# The total catch and stock biomass in the final year
# The SSB in the final year
# The Fbar in the final year

# Assumptions
# The fbar range is 2 to 6
# The natural mortality is the same for all years
# The proportion of F and M before spawning is the same for all years and ages
# There are no discards 

# Hints:
# Save each of the data tables as a *.csv file
# Load them into R and make FLQuant objects (you may need to transpose some of them)
# Make an FLStock object and set all of the slots
